A dataset from Kaggle comprising four classes (monkeypox, chickenpox, measles, and normal skin) was collected. Initially, a 
CNN model was implemented on standardized input images, resulting in overfitting and an accuracy of 77%.  

To address this issue, transfer learning was employed using the VGG16 model, which significantly improved performance, 
achieving an accuracy of 98%.
